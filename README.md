# Spotify 2023 Trending Songs Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the most streamed and trending songs on Spotify for the year 2023. The aim was to understand music trends, popular artists, and song characteristics that resonate with listeners. I utilized Power BI, along with various other technologies, to create an interactive dashboard that turns streaming data into visually appealing, actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

Spotify, as a leading music streaming platform, hosts millions of songs and thousands of artists, making it challenging to identify top trends and understand listener preferences. Without a structured approach to monitor popular tracks and streaming trends, it is difficult for artists, producers, and marketers to make data-driven decisions. I addressed these challenges by developing an automated dashboard that provides real-time insights into trending songs, popular artists, and key song characteristics for 2023.
## Data Source

The analysis uses data from the [Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023?resource=download") dataset on Kaggle, which includes details on track names, artists, streaming counts, playlists, and song characteristics like danceability, energy, and valence.
